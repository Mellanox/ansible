This playbook helps configure the system end to end with centralize routing which is running on leaf03 (as exit router from the system). The overlay subnet is 10.2.4.0/24 and internet subnet is 10.2.5.0/24. The default Gateway for overlay network is 10.2.4.200 and for internet is 10.2.5.1. Please make sure that your servers have right default gateways configured before you start end to end ping. Some pings may be lost in begining as the MAC has to be learned.
